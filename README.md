# Temperature Node Example
Simple temperature node example using Arduino UNO and the RN2483 LoRa module


## To be able to use this example with IDE8 you have to do the following within your workspace:

- Run setup.sh script to download required dependencies
- Create new application in TTN
- Add payload format shown below to TTN application
- Compile, program and run firmware/tempnode.ino on device
- Extract Device EUI printed by the device to the serial terminal
- Register device in the TTN application using Device EUI
- Update firmware/secrets.h with Application EUI and Application Key generated by TTN for the device.
- Compile, program and run firmware/tempnode.ino, again
- Open www/graph.html and see temperature sent from the device being displayed in the chart


## Known limitatons with IDE8 beta

- 

## TTN payload format

```js
function Decoder(bytes, port) {
  return {
     'temperature' : (bytes[0] << 8) + bytes[1]
  };
}
```
